This is achieved by creating a Seq2Seq neural network model in which input the sentences we want to be converted to the target sentences. This is every help especially in today's world. File seq2seq_nmt_model.ipynb contains the full code to buliding the seq2seq encoder decoder model.Dataset folder contains the sentences used for training the model
## Web Application
The directory NMT_WebApp conatins the frontend and backend code required to make a web application and test our solution.Web application can be seen working next. I used Flask web framework of python to test and deploy the application
